# CIFAR-100 Classification with VGG-16 Architecture

This repository contains code for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the VGG-16 architecture on the CIFAR-100 dataset. Additionally, it demonstrates the integration of synthetic images into the training data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Dataset
The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is split into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

## Synthetic Images
Synthetic images are added to the training data to augment the dataset and improve model performance. These images are resized to match the dimensions of the CIFAR-100 dataset.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture follows the VGG-16 architecture, consisting of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Training
The model is trained for a specified number of epochs with a batch size of 64. Early stopping is employed to prevent overfitting, monitoring the validation loss and terminating training if no improvement is observed for a certain number of epochs.

## Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset, calculating the test loss and accuracy.

## Results
- **Training Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 71.10% on the training data.
- **Test Accuracy**: Obtained a test accuracy of around 44.83%.
- **Loss Curves**: Visualizations of training and validation loss, as well as training and validation accuracy, are provided to analyze the model's performance over epochs.

## Usage
1. Ensure all necessary libraries are installed (`tensorflow`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `PIL`, `seaborn`).
2. Mount Google Drive if using Google Colab to access the dataset and save models.
3. Run the provided code cells in a Python environment.
